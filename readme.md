# Keepers - a Tumblr Theme

## Introduction

I wrote this theme for fun as a weekend project. I wanted to put all that reading I've done about design and put it to use and make something. I also felt that making it public would give me a push to put more work and more throught into it. I ended up liking the design enough to switch my main blog to it.

## Features
* None? This is about as bare-bones as you get

## Perks
* big text, big pictures. If you want to really focus on your content, this is the way to go
* responsive! I'm using Dave Gamache's Skeleton framework - try resizing the window
* open-source, obviously

## Downsides
* not tested for cross-browser compatibility
* still working out kinks with mobile screens and text
* opinionated as hell, and removed many parts that some might will miss

## Thanks To
* Dave Gamache for Skeleton
* Anders M. Andersen for the CSS trick to make embeds responsive
* all the people who provided feedback
