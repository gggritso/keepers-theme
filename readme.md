# Keepers - a Tumblr Theme

## Introduction

Is readme-driven design a thing yet? I'm writing this Tumblr theme as an interesting side project, because I think it'd be a good experience to design something from scratch, with no contraints. This is a learning exercise and a functional redesign of my main site. If the theme ends up being good, I will re-skin my site using it, and possibly upload it to the theme garden.

I wanted a way to put all the reading I've been doing into practice and put together something that I'd been working on and thinking about for a long time.

## Goals
* simple, pleasant style that has personality but lets the content take centre stage
* build on a responsive boilerplate and looks good for all devices
* functional and modern in a practical sense
* text content is kind, and as a corrolary types of text like conversations and quotes get the same treatment as regular text
* documented well enough to customize easily, and is extensible by nature

## Thanks To
* Dave Gamache for the Skeleton boilerplate I used
* Anders M. Andersen for the responsive embed CSS
* the dude who wrote the infinite scroll plugin for Tumblr
* Google for fonts
* all the people who provided feedback
